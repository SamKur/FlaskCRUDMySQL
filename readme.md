This is a simple **Flask** web application that allows users to perform **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a user database using **MySQL**. It serves as a practical example of how to integrate Flask with a relational database while demonstrating my understanding of web development concepts.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Management**: Add, edit, and delete users with a simple interface.
- **Data Validation**: Ensures that user inputs meet specific criteria for names, emails, and ages.
- **Responsive Design**: Basic HTML structure for a clean and user-friendly experience.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative error messages for unique constraint violations and invalid input.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Python** 🐍: The core programming language for the application.
- **Flask** 🚀: A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- **MySQL** 🗄️: A relational database management system for storing user data.
- **PyMySQL** 📦: A Python library to interact with MySQL databases.

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/SamKur/FlaskCRUDMySQL.git
cd FlaskCRUDMySQL
```
### 2. Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
```
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate  # For linux use: source venv/bin/activate
```
### 3. Install required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 4. Set up the MySQL database:
Run the SQL commands in mysql_code.sql to create the database and table.
### 5. Run the application:
```
python app.py
```
### 6. Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000.


## 📈 Usage
- **Home Page**: View a list of all users.
- **Add User**: Fill out the form to add a new user to the database.
- **Edit User**: Update existing user information.
- **Delete User**: Remove users from the database.

## 💡 Personal Touch
This project showcases my ability to integrate backend technologies and provides a solid foundation in web development. It highlights my:

- **Problem-Solving Skills**: Implementing user validation and error handling to create a seamless user experience.
- **Attention to Detail**: Ensuring that data integrity is maintained through validation and unique constraints.
- **Continuous Learning**: Exploring new technologies and frameworks to build robust applications.


## 📚 Conclusion
This Flask CRUD application is a testament to my skills as a developer.
